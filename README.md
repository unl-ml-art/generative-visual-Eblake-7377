# Project 3 Generative Visual

## Abstract

I plan on making 3d objects from text. Starting with a text to image Gan, load the outcomes into either a 3D gan or a image to 3d program, and create stylistic objects. The text would consist of abstract of ideas, and concepts that are not tangile in the phycisal world, my hope is to create a more develped asset and understnading of what these formless could look like. 

Today, Art is in question. The use of articifial intigellecne and random image generations outputs an overflow of art and so do the artists of taday. A debate rises all centered on the notion who is the artist the one who clicked the button or the computer and why should it have value if anyone can generte it. Are the masses only intenrested in it becasue it is the equivlent of a monkey solving a puzzle? 

The worth of an artist is placed on them by their work and how they can evoke ideas and emotions, when  computeres can generate the equivlent of that it makes one wonder how to value work as a whole. 

When I create art, I often let my hand directr me and then build my content, I believe the inspiration and tone can be an abstract interpreation of life events, current emotions or philospical oppostion. Trying to simulate my own fabrication of abstract notions I wrote prompts in a Text to Image GAN and then used style trasnfer using my past work on the gerneated text to image outputs. When running the code I found myself tryign to title this piece and wanted to call it copycat becasue that was in a sense what I was trying to do, but in the end I found this work to be sepreate of my own. This was a collaboration or organic and inogranic work.
