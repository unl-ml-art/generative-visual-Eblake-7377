# Project 3 Generative Visual

## Abstract

I plan on making 3d objects from text. Starting with a text to image Gan, load the outcomes into either a 3D gan or a image to 3d program, and create stylistic objects. The text would consist of abstract of ideas, and concepts that are not tangile in the phycisal world, my hope is to create a more develped asset and understnading of what these formless could look like.
