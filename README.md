# Project 3 Generative Visual - Copycat to Colaborator

## Abstract

Today, Art is in question. The use of articifial intigellecne and random image generations outputs an overflow of art and so do the artists of today. A debate rises  centered on the notion who is the artist the one who clicked the button or the computer. Why should it have value if anyone can generte it? Are the masses only intenrested in it becasue it is the equivlent of a monkey solving a puzzle? 

The worth of an artist is placed on them by their work and how they can evoke ideas and emotions, when  computeres can generate the equivlent of that it makes one wonder how to value work as a whole. 

When I create art, I often let my hand direct me and then build my content, I believe the inspiration and tone can be an abstract interpreation of life events, current emotions or philospical oppostion. Trying to simulate my own fabrication of abstract notions I wrote prompts in a Text to Image GAN and then used style trasnfer using my past work on the gerneated text to image outputs. When running the code I found myself trying to title this project and wanted to call it, "Copycat" becasue that was in a sense what I was trying to do, but in the end I found this work to be sepreate of my own. This was a collaboration between organic and inogranic beings.

## Technical Notes

When trying to write the prompts, word choice and length plays a big part. I found that specific terms impact the initial image when wrtiing in prompts, so consider what you what you are wanting to get from your prompts because that cxan change the colors palette and compostion.
